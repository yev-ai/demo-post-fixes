# TypeScript Specifics

- Access objects safely, properly using "?." and "??". Sparingly use "!" when appropriate.
- Use modern TypeScript 5+ features like "satisfies", "infer", "asserts", "as const", etc.
- Prefer the mapReduce pattern when possible, especially for arrays, sets, and maps.

# Documentation Instructions

- Use JSDoc-style comments, specifying types, parameters, and return values clearly.
- Your audience are seasoned engineers so avoid over-explaining simple concepts.
- Write clear and concise comments explaining the "why", not just the "what".
