# Purpose

- Complete original project goal feature parity.
- Lots of cleanup, refactoring, and optimizations.

# TODO

- Relearn react and fix this project to best practices

  - NextJS is fairly prescriptive; use standard stuff like:
    - node, react, react router, express
  - interview was an example of code NOT to write lol
  - need to relearn basically ...everything
  - focus on state management like redux

- Swap to Supabase for Auth, PGV, and Realtime.
- Swap to Anthropic context protocol
- client vs server tool usage because WebRTC
- Go from there

# Done

- Swap infra so we don't deploy over the original repo
  - Changed deployment branch to /prod
