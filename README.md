# CoderPad Parity

## Drawing

A Miro board will be our substitute for CoderPad's drawing feature.

## Environment

- Items located within the .github and .cicd directories serve as substitutes for CoderPad's development environment.
- Endpoints and API keys unavailable within CoderPad will be injected into the container during deployment.
- Refer to .cicd/pulumi/README.md for detailed instructions on self-deploying this project.
- The infrastructure will mirror CoderPad's subdomain deployment model.

## Coding Session

The following information will be provided to my point of contact via email by 12:30pm CST on 03/19/2025:

- Application login credentials
- Deployment endpoint domain
- Miro board password
- Miro board link

The coding session will start from the CoderPad barebones template at 1:00pm CST on 03/19/2025 and stop at 5:00pm CST.
