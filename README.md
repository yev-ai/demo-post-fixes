# CoderPad Parity

## Drawing

A Miro board will be our substitute for CoderPad's drawing feature.

## Environment

Items located within the .github and .cicd directories serve as substitutes for CoderPad's development environment.

## Notes

Infrastructure is a mess but the goal there was to mirror CoderPad for a fair and impartial interview process.

Beginning code assessment.

- 1:00pm - starting requirement analysis, system design, and implementation plan in Miro
- 1:43pm - harsh reality check. I'm rusty at react and will be reverse engineering a repo i found
  - otherwise I may spend most of the remaining 3hr15min on UI and i dont think thats the point here
- 1:45pm - auth is done, back to miro to determine what I should do next.
  - i decided on webrtc first. implementing /webrtc-base
- 3:19pm - webrtc stream was harder than expected. 1hr45left, will focus on english-english transcript.
